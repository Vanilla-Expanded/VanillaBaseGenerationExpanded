  <description>Vanilla Base Generation Expanded is a mod many have been waiting for. Probably one of the most disappoint aspects of venturing out in a caravan in RimWorld is the fact that no matter where you go and no matter what base you raid, after you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all. Vanilla Bases tend to often resemble so called ‘20 granite door borg cube bases’.

Kikohi set out on a mission to fix that, and with the help from our testing community, we have created a huge library of assets that the base will pull out of, procedurally generating unique villages, towns and megabases every time you visit a new location.

The look of the bases and the assets use vary from faction to faction - tribal villages will have swathes of farmland around them, whilst pirate bases will be essentially bunkers with mortars and automatic defenses.</description>
